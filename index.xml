Today is the 28th of August, which marks exactly a month of my time here in the West, more specifically in the United States of America. The journey to the West seemed daunting and close to impossible when I first registered for an English proficiency test, which exists for people who want to travel to the West and are not native English speakers (like me).
My journey It started on a sad note after waving a teary goodbye to my parents and relatives back home.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on first tech talk</title><link>/posts/relfection-first-tech-talk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 16:18:04 +0530</pubDate><guid>/posts/relfection-first-tech-talk/</guid><description>Giving a tech talk was no more than a far-fetched idea until I interacted with Vincent who was kind enough to sponsor a ticket for remotely held Python Pizza conference during COVID.

You can always contribute to a 5 minute lightning talk. There&amp;rsquo;s bound to be a super awesome function that you&amp;rsquo;ve learned that others don&amp;rsquo;t know about.

Lekh is my first take at designing a Hugo theme, and apart from the tiny bit of templating specific to Hugo in Golang, the rest is copied as it is from Vegard&amp;rsquo;s site. Also the dark mode is taken as it is from https://www.gwern.net/</description></item></channel></rss>
