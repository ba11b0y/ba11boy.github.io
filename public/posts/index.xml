      <description>This site is powered by a Hugo theme called lekh which is a Hugo clone(almost) of https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/
Lekh is my first take at designing a Hugo theme, and apart from the tiny bit of templating specific to Hugo in Golang, the rest is copied as it is from Vegard&amp;rsquo;s site. Also the dark mode is taken as it is from https://www.gwern.net/</description>
