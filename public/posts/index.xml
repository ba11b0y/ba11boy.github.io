      <description>Hello!&#xA;Today is the 28th of August, which marks exactly a month of my time here in the West, more specifically in the United States of America. The journey to the West seemed daunting and close to impossible when I first registered for an English proficiency test, which exists for people who want to travel to the West and are not native English speakers (like me).&#xA;My journey It started on a sad note after waving a teary goodbye to my parents and relatives back home.</description>

      <description>Giving a tech talk was no more than a far-fetched idea until I interacted with Vincent who was kind enough to sponsor a ticket for remotely held Python Pizza conference during COVID.&#xA;Quoting him from our twitter DM conversation&#xA;You can always contribute to a 5 minute lightning talk. There&amp;rsquo;s bound to be a super awesome function that you&amp;rsquo;ve learned that others don&amp;rsquo;t know about.&#xA;Fast forward two years, I was fortunate that my workplace organised the 68th meetup of Golang Bangalore, and I managed to talk about the Go scheduler and the syscalls which a Go program makes during runtime.</description>

      <description>This site is powered by a Hugo theme called lekh which is a Hugo clone(almost) of https://www.vegardstikbakke.com/&#xA;Lekh is my first take at designing a Hugo theme, and apart from the tiny bit of templating specific to Hugo in Golang, the rest is copied as it is from Vegard&amp;rsquo;s site. Also the dark mode is taken as it is from https://www.gwern.net/</description>
