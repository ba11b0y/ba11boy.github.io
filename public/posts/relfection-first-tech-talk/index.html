<h1>Reflections on first tech talk</h1>
<p class="post-meta"><time itemprop="datePublished">August 13, 2022</time>
</p>
<p>Giving a tech talk was no more than a far-fetched idea until I interacted with <a href="https://twitter.com/fishnets88">Vincent</a> who was kind enough to sponsor a ticket for remotely held Python Pizza conference during COVID.</p>
<p>Quoting him from our twitter DM conversation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can always contribute to a 5 minute lightning talk. There&rsquo;s bound to be a super awesome function that you&rsquo;ve learned that others don&rsquo;t know about.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward two years, I was fortunate that my workplace organised the 68th meetup of Golang Bangalore, and I managed to talk about the Go scheduler and the syscalls which a Go program makes during runtime.</p>
<p><img src="../../overview.png" alt="overview"></p>
<p>I learnt in detail on how the Go scheduler works and there&rsquo;s a great writeup by <a href="https://rakyll.org/scheduler/">Rakyll</a> and discovered the beautifully documented and written Go runtime <a href="https://go.dev/src/runtime/proc.go">https://go.dev/src/runtime/proc.go</a></p>
<p>And not to miss the very interesting <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/776703/">io_uring</a> which is a fairly new asynchronous API for making syscalls.
I did a fun benchmark during the talk to demonstrate how asynchronous execution at kernel level can really speed up programs which compared a program spawning goroutines to concurrently write to hundred files while the other program leveraging the <code>io_uring</code> subsystem to submit write requests as a batch and writing to the same number of files.
The latter was ~4x faster when benchmarked with <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine">https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine</a> on a machine running Ubuntu kernel version 5.18.</p>
<p>// TODO: Update with the code used to benchmark.</p>
<p>Some people loved the talk, were kind enough to come to me and appreciate, which further led to  conversations around Go. It was great meeting <a href="https://twitter.com/poonai_">Balaji</a> after a long time, and I again forgot to take a picture with him.</p>
<p>I felt very content after the talk, given the feeling of talking about something very interesting and some people loving it and appreciating it.</p>
<p>The talk as a PDF can be found <a href="../../syscalls_and_scheduler.pdf">here</a> and on <a href="https://youtu.be/zgbedmitpyw">youtube</a></p>
